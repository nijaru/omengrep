HF dataset source broken (loading scripts deprecated) - researcher agent launched to find working mirror (a5f878a78fe5ab15d). Check CoIR-Retrieval, Nan-Do, direct jsonl download. og JSON output fields: file, name, type, line, score, content. Match gold by basename of file path (corpus/{idx:06d}.py). Also implement CoSQA if available.",

Root cause: corpus heavy with Azure SDK boilerplate functions that are structurally identical — model can't distinguish them. Script works correctly. Scores all clustered near -12 to -13, no discrimination. Shorter queries or more diverse corpus needed for meaningful numbers."
